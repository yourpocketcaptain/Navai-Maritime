# Garmin inReach & PLBs: The Safety Gear You Hope to Never Use

When things go wrong at sea, they go wrong fast. Man Overboard (MOB), dismasting, or fire. In these moments, your connection to the outside world is your lifeline.

We reviewed the **Garmin inReach Mini 2** and various **PLBs** (Personal Locator Beacons) to see which belongs on your lifejacket.

## The Difference

*   **PLB (e.g., ACR ResQLink):** A one-way scream for help through the COSPAS-SARSAT satellite network. It tells SAR (Search and Rescue) *where* you are, but not *what* is happening. Battery lasts 5-7 years.
*   **Satellite Messenger (e.g., inReach):** Allows two-way text communication. You can say "We are taking on water but pumps are holding" vs "Sinking, abandon ship." This nuance helps Resccue Coordination Centers prioritize assets.

## User Experience Under Stress

The inReach is fantastic, but typing a message on a tiny screen with wet, cold fingers while the boat is pitching 30 degrees is... optimistic. PLBs are simpler: Antenna up, press button.

## The Missing Link: Procedure

Here is the hard truth: **Technology is useless without protocol.** Panic kills more sailors than equipment failure.

Tener el botón de pánico es vital, pero saber qué hacer *después* es lo que salva vidas. 

This is where the **NavAI Safety & Emergency** module becomes a critical piece of gear. 

While you wait for rescue (which can take hours or days), NavAI guides you through:
1.  **MOB Manuevers:** Step-by-step guidance on the Williamson Turn or Anderson Turn.
2.  **Radio Protocols:** Scripts for MAYDAY and PAN-PAN calls so you don't freeze on the radio.
3.  **Damage Control:** Checklists for fire suppression and hull breaches.

Putting an inReach on your vest is great. Putting the knowledge of how to manage a crisis in your pocket is better.

## Verdict

Carry both. Use the PLB for the "End of the World" scenario. Use inReach for communication. And use **NavAI** to lead your crew through the chaos until the helicopter arrives.
