# Automatic Lifejackets: Spinlock Deckvest vs. Helly Hansen

The days of bulky orange foam blocks are over. Modern automatic lifejackets are sleek, ergonomic, and designed to be worn all day. But "all day" comfort is subjective.

We took the **Spinlock Deckvest 6D** and the **Helly Hansen Sailsafe Inflatable** on a 48-hour continuous watch rotation.

## The Spinlock Deckvest 6D

The "Tesla" of lifejackets. It sits off the neck, resting on the shoulders properly.
*   **Pros:** Incredible fit system (HRS), integrated harness release, lights and sprayhood included.
*   **Cons:** Expensive. The buckle system can be fiddly with gloves.

## The Helly Hansen Sailsafe

The traditional choice. Robust, simple, no-nonsense.
*   **Pros:** Easy to don/doff. Familiar feel. Very rugged outer shell.
*   **Cons:** Heavier on the neck after 4 hours.

## The Hidden Danger: Maintenance

Here is the scary statistic: **Over 40% of privately owned auto-inflate jackets fail to inflate** when tested. Why? Corroded CO2 cylinders and expired hydrostatic firing heads.

Un chaleco solo sirve si sabes mantenerlo. It's not a "buy and forget" item.

Inside the **NavAI Engineering & Maintenance** module, we have built a dedicated **Safety Equipment Checklist**. 
*   It reminds you to weight-check your CO2 bottles annually.
*   It tracks the expiry dates of your Hammar or UML firing heads.
*   It logs when you last inspected the bladder for leaks.

Wearing the best Spinlock vest means nothing if the trigger mechanism expired two years ago.

## Verdict

**Spinlock** wins for offshore comfort. **Helly Hansen** wins for coastal durability. 
But **NavAI** wins for ensuring that whichever one you choose actually works when you hit the water.

Make safety maintenance a habit, not a chore.
