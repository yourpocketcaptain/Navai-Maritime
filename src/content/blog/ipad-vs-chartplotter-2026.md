# iPad Pro vs. Dedicated Chartplotters: The 2026 Verdict

It's the debate that lights up every dockside bar: "Do I really need a $3,000 MFD (Multi-Function Display), or can I just use my iPad?" In 2026, the gap has narrowed significantly.

## The Contenders

*   **The Challenger:** iPad Pro M4 (13-inch) with waterproof casing.
*   **The Incumbent:** Latest generation 12-inch Chartplotters (Garmin/Raymarine/B&G).

## Screen Brightness & Heat

**Chartplotters** win here, but barely. They are designed to pump out 1200+ nits indefinitely without overheating. 
The **iPad Pro** peaks higher (1600 nits) but will dim itself if it gets too hot—a real risk in direct Mediterranean summer sun. However, kept under a bimini or sprayhood, the iPad's resolution and touch responsiveness blow any marine hardware out of the water.

## Software Ecosystem

This is where the battle shifts. 
A chartplotter runs proprietary software. It does chartplotting, sonar, and radar. It does them well, but it does *only* that.

An iPad runs... everything.

## The NavAI Advantage

Un plotter solo hace una cosa. Con un iPad, tienes la **Bridge Console de NAVAI**, que incluye herramientas que tu plotter simplemente no tiene.

Imagine having a "second brain" on your bridge. While your plotter shows the map, your iPad running NavAI provides:
*   **Smart Anchoring Calculator:** Calculates the precise scope based on your specific chain weight and seabed type.
*   **AI Maritime Assistant:** Ask complex regulatory questions ("What lights do I show if I'm aground but not making way?") and get instant answers.
*   **Maintenance Logs:** Track engine hours and service intervals right next to your helm.

It is the "cerebro" (brain) that your dedicated hardware is missing.

## Cost

*   **Chartplotter Setup:** ~$3,500 (Unit + Maps + Installation)
*   **iPad Setup:** ~$1,500 (iPad + Case + Mount + NavAI App)

## Verdict

For a primary helm station in open ocean, a dedicated waterproof plotter is still the gold standard for ruggedness. But for the modern captain, an iPad is no longer just a backup—it's the **Intelligence Officer** of the ship.

Run your radar on the plotter. Run your *mind* on the iPad with NavAI.
