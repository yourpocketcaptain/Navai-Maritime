# Top 5 Mistakes in the Yachtmaster/PER Exam

Exam day is stressful. Whether you are aiming for your RYA Yachtmaster Offshore or the Spanish PER, the pressure often leads to silly mistakes on simple topics.

## The Hall of Shame

1. **Lights & Shapes**: Mixing up a "vessel restricted in her ability to maneuver" with a "vessel not under command". Flashcards are your best friend here.
2. **Chart Work Errors**: Forgetting to apply variation or deviation. Always double-check your math!
3. **COLREGs Priority**: Misunderstanding the hierarchy of "privileged" vs "burdened" vessels in crossing situations.
4. **Collision Avoidance Logic**: Making small, hesitant course changes. Examiners want to see **substantial** and **obvious** maneuvers.
5. **Weather Planning**: Not being able to explain a synoptic chart or a sea breeze cycle.

## How to prepare effectively

Don't just read books. Use active recall.

Inside the **NavAI Academy**, we have specific modules designed for these exams. You can [practice your lights and shapes here](/login) or test your knowledge with our AI tutor in the mobile app.

### Good luck!

The sea is a great teacher, but passing the exam is your ticket to explore it safely.
