# AI vs. Human Error: Why your next First Mate will be Digital

Statistically, the ocean is a dangerous place—not because of the waves, but because of the decisions we make. Research shows that nearly **80% of maritime accidents** are rooted in human error, fatigue, or simple oversight.

## The Pressure of the Bridge

Navigation under pressure, complex collision avoidance in heavy traffic, and the manual calculation of stability curves are all "high-risk" zones for the human brain. Fatigue during a night watch can slow reaction times to levels comparable to intoxication.

**This is where the Digital First Mate steps in.**

## How AI Reduces Risk

1. **Collision Avoidance**: Our AI engines process AIS and Radar data faster than any human, projecting multi-ship encounter risks in seconds.
2. **Consistency**: An AI doesn't get tired, hungry, or distracted at 3 AM.
3. **Data Fusion**: AI can combine weather, current, and ship performance data to provide a "safety buffer" that was previously impossible.

### NavAI: Your 24/7 Companion

Our **Captain Mariner AI** is designed not to replace the captain, but to empower them. It serves as a second set of eyes that never sleeps.
