# 5 Signs from Nature that a Storm is 1 Hour Away

High-tech forecasts are incredible, but as any professional mariner knows, there is no substitute for your own eyes. Nature gives off subtle "early warning signs" long before a front arrives on your GRIB file.

Here is how to read the sky like a master navigator.

## 1. The "Mares' Tails" and "Mackerel Sky"
High, wispy cirrus clouds (Mares' Tails) followed by patchy altocumulus (Mackerel Sky) are often the first heralds of a warm front. If you see these, wind and rain are usually 12-24 hours away.

## 2. A Halo Around the Sun or Moon
This isn't a myth. Halos are caused by light refracting through ice crystals in high clouds. It’s a clear indicator of moisture in the upper atmosphere.

## 3. The "Calm Before the Storm"
If the wind suddenly dies and the sea turns glassy and heavy, it often means the air is being pulled upward into an approaching convective cell. Look for darkening horizons.

## 4. Sharp Barometric Drops
While not strictly "visual," checking your barometer every 30 minutes is the captain's best habit. A drop of more than 1 millibar per hour is a clear warning of a developing gale.

## 5. The Smell of the Sea
Moist air carries scents better. If you can suddenly smell the salt or distant seaweed much more clearly than usual, the humidity is rising—an indicator of incoming rain or fog.

## Confirming with Modern Data

Nature gives you the warning; **NavAI** gives you the confirmation. By using our **High-Res Forecasts**, you can compare what your eyes are seeing with real-time satellite models. If both agree, it's time to reef the sails or find a safe anchorage.
