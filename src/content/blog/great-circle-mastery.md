# Mastering the Great Circle: Save Fuel and Time

In long-distance maritime navigation, the shortest distance between two points is not a straight line on a flat map—it's a **Great Circle**.

## What is a Great Circle?

A Great Circle is the intersection of a sphere and a plane that passes through the center point of the sphere. On the Earth's surface, it represents the absolute shortest path between two coordinates.

### Why does it matter?

On a trans-Atlantic or trans-Pacific crossing, following a Great Circle route can save you hundreds of miles compared to a simple Rhumb Line. This means:
*   **Less Fuel**: Directly impacting your bottom line.
*   **Faster ETA**: Critical for cargo and yacht schedules.
*   **Lower Emissions**: Doing your part for the ocean.

## How NavAI helps

Manual calculation of Great Circle waypoints is tedious and prone to error. With the NavAI **Great Circle Tool**, you simply input your departure and arrival, and we calculate the exact vertices and initial course.
