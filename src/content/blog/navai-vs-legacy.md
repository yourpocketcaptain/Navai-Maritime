# NavAI vs. Legacy Software

Walk into any bridge today, and you'll likely see Windows XP-style interfaces, clunky menus, and software that requires a 500-page manual just to calculate trim.

## The Problem with Legacy Systems

1. **User Experience**: Designed by engineers, not mariners.
2. **Speed**: Slow boot times and lagging updates.
3. **Connectivity**: Often isolated from real-time data or cumbersome to sync.

## The NavAI Difference

We built NavAI with a "Mobile-First, User-Always" philosophy.

| Feature | Legacy Systems | NavAI |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Interface | Complex / Tab-heavy | Intuitive / Glassmorphism |
| Offline | Sometimes | 100% Functionality |
| Updates | Manual / Service tech | Automatic / Over-the-air |
| AI Integration | None | Captain Mariner AI engine |

### The Verdict

It's time to bring the bridge into the 21st century. Your tools should be as smart as your navigation.
