# Smart Watches for Sailors: Quatix 7 vs. Apple Watch Ultra

For the gadget-loving sailor, the wrist is the final frontier. 

## Garmin Quatix 7

This is a specialized maritime tool. It connects directly to your Garmin chartplotter. You can steer the autopilot, mark waypoints, and view wind data right on your wrist.
*   **Battery:** Weeks, not days.
*   **Screen:** Transflective (perfect in sunlight, dull inside).

## Apple Watch Ultra 2

The best smartwatch, period. But is it the best for *sailing*?
With apps like Navionics and Orca, it's getting there. The screen is essentially a mini-lighthouse (3000 nits), visible in the brightest conditions.
*   **Battery:** 2-3 days max.
*   **Ecosystem:** Infinite apps.

## Data vs. Strategy

Here lies the distinction. A watch gives you *data* (Speed, Heading, Depth). A computer gives you *strategy*.

Mientras tu reloj te da la posición, **NAVAI te da la estrategia**. 

Use your watch to monitor your SOG (Speed Over Ground). But use the **NavAI Voyage Planner** to compute your Great Circle routes and optimize your ETA.
*   Your watch tells you the current wind.
*   NavAI calculates the **True Wind** vectors and helps you decide the optimal tacking angles.

The watch is a tactical display. NavAI is the strategic processor.

## Verdict

If you have a Garmin boat, buy the **Quatix**. It integrates too well to ignore.
For everyone else, the **Apple Watch Ultra** is a more versatile tool for life on land and sea.

But whichever you wear, ensure your pocket holds the real calculating power.
