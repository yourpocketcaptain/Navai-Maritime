# Mastering GRIB Files: How to read the wind like a Pro

GRIB (General Regularly-distributed Information in Binary) files are the standard for maritime weather reporting. But to many, they look like a chaotic mess of arrows and colors.

## Decoding the Wind Barb

The "feathers" at the end of the wind arrows tell you the speed:
*   **Short feather**: 5 knots.
*   **Long feather**: 10 knots.
*   **Pennant (triangle)**: 50 knots.

Sum them up to get the total wind speed. The arrow points in the direction the wind is **blowing to**.

## Understanding Pressure

Isobars (lines of equal pressure) that are close together indicate a steep pressure gradient. In plain English: **it's going to be windy**.

### Use High-Resolution Models

Avoid using only the GFS model for coastal sailing. Whenever possible, use **ECMWF** or high-resolution models like **AROME** for better local accuracy.

## NavAI Integration

Our **Weather Routing** engine handles the GRIB parsing for you, overlaying safety limits and suggesting courses that keep you out of the "danger zone".
