# The Captain’s Mindset: 3 Mental Frameworks for High-Stakes Decisions

What do airline pilots, surgeons, and sea captains have in common? They all operate in environments where the cost of a mistake is measured in lives and millions of dollars. To survive, they don't rely only on "gut feeling"—they use **mental frameworks** to stay calm when things go wrong.

Whether you are navigating a gale or a corporate crisis, these frameworks will help you lead with clarity.

## 1. The "Sterile Bridge" Concept (Focus Management)
In aviation, the "Sterile Cockpit Rule" prohibits non-essential conversation during critical phases of flight. Captains apply this to the bridge during heavy traffic or docking. 
**The Lesson:** During high-risk moments, cut the noise. Only critical data should reach the decision-maker.

## 2. Priority of Work: Aviate, Navigate, Communicate
This classic hierarchy forces order during a crisis:
*   **Aviate**: Keep the ship floating and moving safely (Stability/Engines).
*   **Navigate**: Know exactly where you are and where you are heading.
*   **Communicate**: Only after the situation is stable do you alert external parties.

## 3. Cognitive Load Management
The human brain is excellent at solving complex problems but terrible at doing manual math under extreme stress. This is why professional bridges use checklists and AI assistants.

### How NavAI Supports the Mindset

We designed the **NavAI Emergency Mode** and **MOB (Man Overboard)** tools to work with these frameworks. Instead of forcing you to remember coordinates or calculate drift while you are panicking, the AI takes over the technical processing—significantly reducing the human error factor.
