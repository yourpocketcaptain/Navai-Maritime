# What living on a boat taught me about the clutter in my life

In a world obsessed with "more," living on a boat is a radical crash course in "less." When every centimeter of storage space and every watt of solar energy counts, you quickly learn to distinguish between *necessity* and *clutter*.

## The 20-Square-Meter Realization

Living in a small, floating space forces a level of intentionality that is impossible in a large house. Every item on a boat must serve multiple purposes, be incredibly durable, and be worth its weight in fuel.

## Digital Minimalism as a Safety Tool

Minimalism isn't just about clothes and gadgets; it's about **information**.
In the old days, a captain's cabin was filled with heavy shelves of paper charts, tide tables, and technical manuals. This weight was physical clutter that required manual searching during a crisis.

Modern digital tools have revolutionized this:
*   **Weight Reduction**: Thousands of pages of maritime academy lessons now live on your phone.
*   **Mental Clarity**: Instead of searching through physical libraries, you use **NavAI** to find the exact stability formula or GRIB data you need in seconds.
*   **Energy Efficiency**: Single-device navigation reduces the energy footprint of the boat’s bridge.

## Focus on the Horizon

By removing the physical and digital clutter, you free up the most important resource of all: your **attention**. NavAI is built on this philosophy of minimalism—providing only the data you need, exactly when you need it, without the noise.
