# Why we are building the future of maritime intelligence

The sea has always been a place of tradition. For centuries, mariners have relied on the stars, paper charts, and experience to navigate the vast oceans. But as we move into 2026, the complexity of modern shipping and yachting requires more than just tradition.

## The Pain Points of the Modern Bridge

Today's officers are overwhelmed with data. AIS, Radar, ARPA, ECDIS—information is everywhere, but intelligence is often missing. We've seen errors in stability calculations lead to disaster, and weather routing that feels more like guesswork than science.

**NavAI was born to solve this.**

## Our Core Pillars

1. **Accessibility**: Tools shouldn't be locked behind expensive, clunky hardware. They should be in your pocket.
2. **Intelligence**: It's not about having more data; it's about having the *right* answer when it matters.
3. **Autonomy**: Reliability means working even when the signal drops in the middle of the Atlantic.

### The Road Ahead

We are just getting started. From AI-driven collision avoidance to automated draft surveys, NavAI is here to be your digital first mate.
