# The Anchoring Math: Stop guessing your chain length

Many sailors use the "5-to-1 ratio" rule of thumb. While it's a safe starting point, true seamanship requires understanding the **catenary curve**—the shape a cable or chain takes under its own weight.

## The Basic Physics

The goal is to ensure the pull on the anchor is **horizontal**. If the angle is too steep, the anchor will break out of the seabed.

### The Scope Formula
For a perfectly straight line (maximum safety/wind), the horizontal distance $L$ is:

$$L = \sqrt{s^2 - h^2}$$

*   **s**: Length of chain deployed.
*   **h**: Total depth (depth + bow height).

## When to add more scope?

1. **Holding Ground**: Mud and sand are great; weeds and rock need more scope.
2. **Wind Force**: As wind increases, the catenary "flattens", requiring more chain to keep the pull horizontal.
3. **Current**: A strong tide can act much like wind.

## Sleep better with NavAI

Calculation on a wet deck at 2 AM is a recipe for disaster. Our **Anchor Scope Assistant** (part of the Bridge Console) takes the depth, your boat's weight, and the forecasted wind to give you a recommended amount of chain.
