# Sailing with Starlink: 5 Apps you need when you have (some) signal

SpaceX’s **Starlink Maritime** has undeniably changed the game. Having high-speed internet in the middle of the Atlantic feels like magic. However, as any blue-water sailor knows, the signal isn't always 100%, and hardware can fail.

## The Hybrid Strategy

The smartest captains use a "Hybrid Strategy": using Starlink to sync data, but relying on apps that function **100% offline** for safety.

### 1. NavAI (The Multi-Tool)
While other apps require a constant ping to their servers for calculations, NavAI allows you to download your entire **Maritime Academy** and use the **Stability Calculator** without a single bar of signal.

### 2. PredictWind
Essential for fetching GRIB files via Starlink. Learn more about [how to read these files like a pro](/blog/mastering-grib-files).

### 3. Windy
Great for visual previews when you have the bandwidth for the rich UI.

### 4. Anchor Watch
Digital assurance for peaceful nights. (We integrated one into the NavAI app too!)

### 5. Maritime Apps for Regulatory Compliance
Offline libraries for COLREGs and SOLAS are a must-have.

## Conclusion

Don't let your safety depend on a satellite dish. Sync in harbor, sail with NavAI.
